# Adapt business policies to changing conditions with decision services

Today, your accounts process is entirely manual, with the amount of invoices only increasing. When first capturing an invoice, you must enter the invoice data into multiple systems. From there, different people must validate the invoice data and match the invoice to the Purchase Order. This results in data entry errors and inconsistencies across multiple systems. After all these steps, you can finally process payment in the ERP system.
This use case demonstrates the use of automation to adapt business policies to changing conditions with business rules.
Are you ready to see flexible business decisions in action?
